libqbe
------

libqbe is a library aimed at qbe users and amateur compiler writers, who crave
luxuries (like division) on platforms which lack hardware support for those. It
is analogous to libgcc or clang's compiler-rt in that sense.

It is not and does not intend to be a drop-in libgcc replacement.
